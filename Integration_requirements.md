# Technical requirements for assembling of the partners’ levels to the joint EMICVL IT project

1. The final project assembling will be made in __Unity 2017.1.1f1__

2. Only those projects made in __Unity 2017.1.1f1__ will be accepted.

3. Partners should provide level project (not asset) in __*.zip__ archive to be assembled to joint IT project 

4. Archive should be named as the following: EMICVL_IT group name_development version 
    
     (e.g: EMICVL_ONU_Beta3.2.zip, EMICVL_TSU_Beta1.0.zip) 

5. Project should be named as the following: EMICVL_IT group name (e.g.,  EMICVL_ONU, EMICVL_TSU) 

## Example:

    Archive//EMICVL_ONU_Beta3.2
                               |
                       Project |[EMICVL_ONU]


6. Content of the level project should have the following structure (folders) to be used in the project:

  - Animation (level animation files)
  - Textures  (level texture files) 
  - Materials (level material files)
  - Models    (models used on the level)
  - Prefabs   (prefabs used on the level) 
  - Sounds    (sound files used on the level)
  - Scripts   (scripts used on the level)
  - Sprites   (sprites used on the level)

    __! Additional assets should be added to the level project as a separate folder__

Example:

    //EMICVL_<GROUP_NAME>|
                         |[AdditionalAsset (AssetName)]
                         |[Animation]
                         |[Materials]
                         |[Models]
                         |[Prefabs]
                         |[Scripts]
                         |[Sound]
                         |[Sprites]
                         |[Textures]
              
7.  All extra content should be removed from the level project (textures, code, models, etc.)

8. If an avatar has some distinctive features different from the standard, this should be mentioned in in-line file. It is recommended to use standard avatar from the first-person point of view taken from the standard asset without any addons.

9. __IN CASE IF LEVEL PROJECT AUTHORS USE THE STANDARD AVATAR FROM THE STANDARD UNITY ASSET, THEY SHOULD PROVIDE FOR ASSEMBLING TWO VERSIONS OF PROJECT LEVEL: ONE WITH AN AVATAR AND THE OTHER ONE WITHOUT AN AVATAR. ALL CONTENT OF THE STANDARD UNITY ASSET SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE VERSION “WITHOUT AN AVATAR”. STANDARD ASSET IS ALREADY PRESENT IN THE CORE OF JOINT PROJECT__

10.  Restructured project level should be tested by the developers themselves to be fully working. Assembling group will not be held liable for the non-working level uploaded and assembled, as the core of joint project is organized, as this needed for the direct level upload.

11. Restructured and fully working project level should be provided to the EMICVL project experts to be approved for final assembling.

12. The dead line to provide the final version of level projects to the experts is 5th November.

13. The licences should accompany every level project and should be provided to the experts not later then 5th November

14. Level projects, approved by experts should be sent to ONU team for final assembling not later then 9th November.
